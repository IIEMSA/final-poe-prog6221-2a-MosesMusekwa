# Recipe Creator
This is a Recipe Creator application written in C#. Users can develop and maintain recipes by adding ingredients and processes. Printing a recipe, scaling a recipe, resetting ingredient quantities, and clearing a recipe are all functionalities of the app.

This project's target audience could be anyone who wishes to produce and organize their own recipes. Individuals who enjoy cooking and want a digital tool to keep track of their recipes can use it. The Recipe Creator has an easy-to-use interface for entering ingredients and stages, making it simple for users to develop and manage their culinary masterpieces.

Based on the feedback i got from my lecturer,i will add the following things that were missing in the fist and second part of my project for enhancement :

. screen shots showing commits  

.read me file  

.Cs files 

.A unit test  to test the calorie calculation.

.The 300-calorie notification  using a delegate.

.Selected feature (filter)  that works correctly.




Overall, this project aims to simplify the process of recipe management and provide a helpful tool for cooking enthusiasts.
